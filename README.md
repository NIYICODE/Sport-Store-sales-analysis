# Sport-Store-sales-analysis
I analyzed and Visualized the sales data of a sports store using Excel, SQL and Tableau
## Datasets Overview
-----------------------------------
In this all inclusive project, the dataset contains data relating to sales information of a fictitious sports store.
The goal of this project is to analyze the trends in sales and ratings of the store in order to drive more sales and identify where adequate energy should be channeled to record more sales.


 The dataset consists of 2,848 rows and 12 columns in total for both the customers and orders table. The columns include order_id, customer_id,sport,revenue,profit,shipping cost,rating for the orders table while the customers table columns include; customer_id, first name, last name, email, and state.

 ## Metadata
 ------------------------------------------------
 - Order_id: This is a unique identifier that identifies each order placed by individual customers
 - customer_id: This identifies the customer initiating an order
 - sport: This is a column for the type of sport for which an order was placed
 - revenue: This refers to the total income generated by each sport
 - profit: This is the financial gain obtained by subtracting expenses and cost from the total revenue
 - Shiiping cost: This is the logistics to get the ordered product to the right customer who ordered it, for this project, orders less than $49 attracts a shipping cost of $7, while that with more than $49 attracts zero shipping cost, this is to encourage customers to order for more products from the store

## To gather insights on how the company is performing as regards the sales and market share, I provided answers to the following questions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. What are the totals number of orders made?
2. What is the total revenue generated, the total profit and profit margin?
3. What is the revenue trend across all sport categories?
4. What is the revenue and profit generated monthly?

## The Processes I employed in order to provide solutions to the above questions are:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Cleaned the dataset using microsft excel, by removing duplicates, standardizing datatypes, filling up blank spaces etc
- Utilized SQL to perform some data explorations
- Loaded the exported data from SQL into tableaau for visualization
- Created relationships; data modelling between the tables via model view in tableau
- Designed my dashboard with the report and most important metrics
